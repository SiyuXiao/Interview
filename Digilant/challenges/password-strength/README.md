# password-strength

Create a script in Python that scores the strength of a password.

We should consider these four groups:  lowercase and uppercase letters, symbols and figures.

One password should be considered as not valid if doesn't include at least one element of the groups exposed.
That means that the function should return 0.

Apart of that as much of combination of elements contains the password much higher should be the response of
the check_password_strength function.

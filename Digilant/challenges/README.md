# challenges

Hello.

This folder is composed by some challenges that have been selected to be made in different ways.
There's no one only solution. But definitely we'll evaluate the time efficiency, resource-consuming, and formatting.
The programming challenges can be done in any language, including ASM (I hope is not your case).

You'll have 3 days to do these challenges, so if you can't do the challenges for today or tomorrow don't panic. There's no rush.
